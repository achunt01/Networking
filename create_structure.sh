# Networking Repository

Welcome to the Networking Repository! This repository contains resources, documentation, and information related to various networking topics. Below is a brief overview of the directories and topics covered in this repository:

## Directory Structure

- [Routing and Switching](Routing-and-Switching/OSPF.md): Documentation and resources related to routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP) and switching technologies.
- [Network Security](Network-Security/Firewalls.md): Information on network security principles, practices, and technologies (e.g., firewalls, VPNs).
- [Wireless Networking](Wireless-Networking/WiFi.md): Resources related to wireless network technologies and standards (e.g., Wi-Fi, 5G).
- [Network Design](Network-Design/SD-WAN.md): Design principles and best practices for designing networks, including topics like SD-WAN and network virtualization.
- [Network Management](Network-Management/SNMP.md): Tools and techniques for managing and monitoring networks effectively.
- [TCP/IP](TCP-IP/Subnetting.md): Detailed information on the TCP/IP protocol suite and its applications in networking.
- [DNS and DHCP](DNS-DHCP/DNS.md): Documentation on DNS (Domain Name System) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) services.
- [Load Balancing](Load-Balancing/Algorithms.md): Information on load balancing techniques and technologies.
- [SDN (Software-Defined Networking)](SDN/Overview.md): Resources on SDN concepts, architectures, and implementations.
